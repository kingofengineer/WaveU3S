## Introduction

![framework](./figure/image.jpg) 

  **This repo is code of WaveU3S: A Lightweight Wavelet Dual-attention Unet For 3D Medical Image Segmentatio (ISBI2024).**
  
WaveU3S is a segmentation network for 3D medical image. Its purpose is to reducing the computation burden while maintaining the performance under 3D segmentation tasks. We use nnUNet as default data preprocessing method and training framework. Comparative experiments were conducted on [Flare22](https://flare22.grand-challenge.org/Dataset/) and [ACDC](https://humanheart-project.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/database/#collection/637218c173e9f0047faa00fb) datasets.
